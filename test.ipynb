      "Huh... Well that was disgusting.\n",
      "Why the hell would you do that?\n",
      "And the worst part is that I still don't feel nihilistic. In fact, I think that no one should do such a thing!\n",
      "I guess that I should learn from a true expert instead. I'll go look for Oddward - he's a true master of despair!\n",

      "If only there was some way around this place…\n",
